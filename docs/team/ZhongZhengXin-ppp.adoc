== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: Add `schedule` and `reschedule` command.

** Overview: +
Both commands require similar parameters such as date, time, duration and description. The difference is that schedule command requires all parameters presented while rescheduling command only needs at least one of them.

** Justification: +
The enhancements complement one of the significant functionality of Vetterappointments which is to schedule appointments.

** Highlights: +
Appointment associates with date, time, duration and description in aggregation. The benefit is that all the component class
still survives even when an appointment is deleted.

* *Minor Enhancements*: Add support to detect appointment clashes, invalid duration and show suggestions for a valid length.
